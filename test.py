# bubble sort questions:
# i.len: length,
# range,
#print
# bubble_sort
#ii. all function but bubble sort aren't defined in the file, they are native python functions
#iii. there are two for loops, one is nested in the other.
#iv. there is one conditional statement: if, it's nested in two for loops
#v. the deepest level of nesting is an if statement nested in a for loop nested in another for loop
#vi. yes, it takes an arr argument, which is an array.
#vii. bubble_sort("the array you want to put")
#viii. the function doesn't change it's name
#ix. it's not underlined for me in my ide
#x. that one isn't underline either
#xi. range(len(array)) is a nested function

#2.ii.the outer loop of bubble_sort goes through each value of the range of the array
#iii. it goes through each array value and compares it to the next, swapping them if they are out of order.
#iv. when the loop gets to the i-1 term, it compares it to the i term, swapping them if i is not already the largest number.
#v.they will both run, but no array values will get swapped.
#vi.

#3.ii. it works with string, it compares them, and alphabetizes them
